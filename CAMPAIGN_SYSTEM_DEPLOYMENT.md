### Modified Files:
8. `app.py` - Updated with:
   - Import statements for campaign modules
   - Command system integration in chat endpoint

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Files to GitHub

Upload the following files:
- `campaign_database_schema.py`
- `campaign_auto_save.py`
- `campaign_recall.py`
- `campaign_ai_integration.py`
- `campaign_session_api.py`
- `command_system.py`
- `campaign_session_ui.html`

### 2. Database Initialization

The system will automatically create the necessary tables on first run:
- `campaigns`
- `campaign_sessions`
- `campaign_npcs`
- `campaign_locations`
- `campaign_items`

## Troubleshooting

### Commands not working:
- Check that `command_system.py` is imported in `app.py`
- Verify command integration in chat endpoint
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Campaign UI not showing:
- Verify `campaign_session_ui.html` content is inserted into HTML template
- Check for CSS conflicts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Campaign export/import functionality
- Session notes and journal
- NPC relationship graphs
- Location maps integration
- Item inventory management

- Timeline visualization
- Campaign statistics dashboard

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
3. Test API endpoints directly with curl/Postman
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
5. Review this deployment guide for missed steps
